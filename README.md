Game breakdown:
1.  Allow players to take turn placing chips in board
2.  Display notice when one player gets four chips in a row

How?
1.
    - Declare variable keeping track of who's turn it is (player)
    - On game play, clone a black/red chip into appropriate column on game board
    - Check win status (task 2) (how??)
    - Change player after the game play has occurred
    - Maybe make some visual representation of who's turn it is
2.
    1. After each placement, check for 4 in a row
        -track the locations of chips using row/column identifiers


        keep track of how many pieces each player has left after each turn
